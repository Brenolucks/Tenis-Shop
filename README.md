# Tenis Shop

Cloning UI project for dribble for my studies in flutter. I'm not using state management because my goal at this moment is to study about Containers, Columns, Rows, Stacks, ListViews, Componentization, Creating my own widgets and others things.

## My version

This is my version at this moment and i changed somethings to make it a little more my "face". I tried to use StatefulWidget in categories carousel but i haved some problems with state manipulation.
